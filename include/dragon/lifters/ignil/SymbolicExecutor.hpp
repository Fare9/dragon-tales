/// Symbolic execution of IGNIL over Z3 bitvectors.
///
/// The executor interprets a Block (or any Op sequence) against a
/// SymbolicState, producing a Z3 expression for every value the block
/// computes. Registers and memory may be seeded concretely, symbolically, or
/// left undefined - an undefined location reads back as a fresh free
/// variable, so a block always executes even when its inputs are unknown.
///
/// Two uses drive the design:
///
///   1. Solving. Symbolise an input buffer, run a checksum/crypto block, then
///      ask the solver for an input that makes the output equal a target
///      value (SymbolicExecutor::solve).
///
///   2. Control-flow recovery. A JMP or CJMP whose target is a computed value
///      (a VM dispatch, a jump table, an opaque predicate) is resolved by
///      enumerating the target expression's satisfying values under the
///      accumulated path constraints. RunResult::successors then names the
///      concrete addresses actually reachable, which is what a CFG
///      reconstructor needs.
///
/// Everything here is architecture-agnostic: the executor only ever sees
/// ignil::Reg offsets, so an x86 block (dragon::x86 register descriptors) and
/// an AArch64 block (dragon::arm) run through the same code.
///
/// Only available when the library is built with -DDRAGON_USE_Z3=ON.
