/// This is the IGNIL analogue of Triton's block dead-store elimination
/// (BasicBlock `simplify`): a value written to a register or flag that is
/// overwritten before it is ever read - and is not live on exit from the block
/// - carries no information and its producing op can be dropped. Unlike
/// simplifyBlock's dead-*Temp* elimination, this also removes dead *Reg* stores,
/// which is what collapses the junk-instruction noise VM protectors emit
/// (a wall of rcl/shld/setcc/and writing registers that are immediately
/// popped over).
///
/// The register address space is treated as a flat byte array, so overlapping
/// sub-registers alias correctly: writing AX (bytes [0,2)) kills AL and AH but
/// leaves the rest of RAX live; writing AL (byte 0) leaves AH (byte 1) live.
/// Flags are ordinary single-byte registers and fold into the same analysis.
///
/// `liveOut` names the registers whose value is observable after the block:
///   - std::nullopt (the default) means "assume everything is live on exit",
///     the conservative model Triton uses. A store is then removed only when it
///     is provably overwritten *within this block* before any read, which needs
///     no ABI knowledge and is always sound. This reproduces Salwan's VMProtect
///     example: every junk write is clobbered by a later junk write or a pop,
///     while the pops themselves are the last writers and survive.
///   - a Reg list means precisely those registers (their byte ranges) are live
///     out; anything else is dead at exit and may be eliminated more
///     aggressively (e.g. a RET-terminated block whose live-out is just the ABI
///     return + callee-saved registers). Correctness then rests entirely on the
///     caller supplying a sound live-out set.
///
/// Block-local, semantics-preserving, and conservative: side-effecting ops
/// (STORE/CALL/JMP/CJMP/RET, and per hasSideEffect any control transfer) are
/// never removed, and a store is dropped only when *every* byte it clobbers is
/// dead. Also drops dead Temps (block-local by construction), subsuming the
/// Temp DCE in simplifyBlock so a lifted machine instruction whose only live
/// effect was the removed register write collapses entirely.
