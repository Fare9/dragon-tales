/// Function-signature recovery: which registers a function reads as inputs
/// (its arguments) and whether it produces a result (its return value).
///
/// This is the forward counterpart to BackwardSlicer. The slicer answers "what
/// does this one value depend on"; argument recovery answers "what does this
/// whole function consume and produce", which is what turns a lifted blob into
/// something with a real prototype - the first step toward readable,
/// reconstructed code.
///
/// The core is an ordinary live-variable analysis over the function's IGNIL
/// CFG: a register that is read along some path from the entry before it is
/// written is *live-in*, i.e. the function expects a caller to have set it.
/// Intersecting the live-in set with the target's calling convention (which
/// registers carry the first N integer arguments) yields the argument list;
/// the convention's return register, if the body ever writes it, yields the
/// return value.
///
/// Scope and documented limitations (this recovers the common integer/pointer
/// ABI shape, not every corner of it):
///   - Integer class only. Floating-point/vector arguments (XMM/SIMD), structs
///     passed in registers, and stack-passed arguments beyond the register
///     count are not recovered.
///   - Register-offset granularity. A read of EDI counts as a use of the RDI
///     slot; sub-register width is not tracked through the dataflow (it is only
///     consulted to size the return value).
///   - Arguments are reported as the contiguous convention prefix up to the
///     highest live-in argument register, matching how compilers allocate them.
///   - Conventions modelled: x86-64 System V and AArch64 AAPCS64.
