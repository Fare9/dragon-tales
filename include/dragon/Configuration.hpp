/// In addition to syntax and strategy, two LLVM-level knobs are exposed:
///
///   cpu     -> selects the target micro-architecture.  An empty string lets
///              LLVM choose its built-in "generic" baseline for the triple,
///              which may not enable optional ISA extensions.
///              Examples:
///                "cortex-a8"   → ARMv7-A with Thumb2, NEON, VFPv3
///                "arm926ej-s"  → ARMv5TEJ, enables BX/BLX
///                "skylake"     → x86-64 with AVX2, BMI2, etc.
///                "sifive-u74"  → RISC-V 64 with M/A/C extensions
///
///   features -> fine-grained ISA feature flags, comma-separated.
///              A '+' prefix enables a feature; a '-' prefix disables it.
///              These are combined with those implied by `cpu`.
///              Examples:
///                "+v4t"        → enable ARMv4T on ARM (adds BX)
///                "+v7,+neon"   → ARMv7 with NEON
///                "+avx2"       → enable AVX2 on x86
///                "+m,+a,+c"    → RISC-V multiply, atomics, compressed
///
/// Leaving both empty is safe and targets the most conservative baseline
/// for each architecture.
